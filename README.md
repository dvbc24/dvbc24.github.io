### what is this repo for?
it's to host my personal IPTV playlist and resources for it.

### what channels does it have?
WIP but the list includes stuff from the UK, USA, Canada, and Latin America. it focuses on official sources and stable services like TVheadends, astra control panels, and flussonic instances.

### should i use this as my main list?
well I don't recommend it, since it's a personal playlist. it's just me updating this on my own time and not a team of people. 

if you want a smaller, simpler list then you're welcome to use this.

however if you want a largely maintained list with more channels, i suggest you check out [aria](https://github.com/theariatv/theariatv.github.io). i'm a co-maintainer there and things seem to run pretty well.

### if you already contribute to aria, what's the point of this list?
there are many channels on aria i personally don't watch. less is more for some people. 

imagine you find two ice cream shops next to each other. one has just the basic flavors: let's say.. vanilla, chocolate, raspberry, coconut, strawberry. and the other has this vast majority of "gourmet" flavors with tons of different toppings you can choose from.

now, most people will probably choose the second shop. but what if you're not really into all that different variety? sometimes less choices = more simplicity

### can i report a dead stream or request a channel?
yes, but for requests it'll have to be a channel from the regions i mentioned above.

### i am/represent a copyright holder of either a channel or program/event being broadcast on one of the channels in this list.
contact me at voxel0@disroot.org and I'll remove the stream from my list.
however please keep in mind i do not host nor control the streams in this list in any way, i'm simply linking to publicly available streams, presumably actually made public by copyright holders, which if i'm being contacted for this turns out not to be the case.
